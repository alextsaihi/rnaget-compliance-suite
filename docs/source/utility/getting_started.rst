Getting Started
====================================

The RNAget compliance tool provides insight into how compliant a server is with
the specification. The tool can be installed and executed from the command line,
and can be configured to run compliance tests against any RNAget server of interest.

When run, the compliance tool generates a report, indicating which test cases 
succeeded and failed, as well as messages explaining why a test may have failed.

The `next article <installation.html>`_ provides instructions on how to install the 
RNAget compliance tool.
